## 1. What is Ruby?

Answer:

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It is often used for web development, scripting, and creating powerful yet readable code.

## 2. How do you define a class in Ruby?

Answer:

In Ruby, you can define a class using the class keyword followed by the class name. Here's an example:

```ruby
class MyClass
  # Class definition
end
```

## 3. Explain the difference between nil and false in Ruby.

Answer:

nil represents the absence of a value or "nothing," while false is a boolean value that represents "false" in a conditional context. nil is often used to indicate the absence of a value, whereas false is explicitly used as a boolean value.

## 4. How do you define a method in Ruby?

Answer:

In Ruby, you can define a method using the def keyword followed by the method name, parameters (if any), and the method body. Here's an example:

```ruby
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

## 5. Explain the concept of modules in Ruby.

Answer:

Modules in Ruby allow you to group related methods, constants, and classes together. They provide a way to organize and reuse code. Modules can be included in classes using the include keyword, allowing the class to inherit the module's behavior.

## 6. How do you handle exceptions in Ruby? Provide an example.

Answer:

In Ruby, you can handle exceptions using the begin, rescue, and end keywords. Here's an example:

```ruby
begin
  # Code that might raise an exception
rescue ExceptionClass => e
  # Handle the exception
  puts "An exception occurred: #{e.message}"
end
```

## 7. What is the difference between puts, print, and p in Ruby?

Answer:

- 'puts' adds a newline character after printing the output.
- 'print' does not add a newline character.
- 'p' is similar to 'print' but provides a more detailed representation of the object, including its data type.

## 8. How do you iterate over an array in Ruby? Provide an example.

Answer:

You can iterate over an array using various methods, such as each, map, or for loops. Here's an example using the each method:

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.each do |number|
  puts number
end
```

## 9. What are symbols in Ruby? Provide an example.

Answer:

Symbols in Ruby are lightweight, immutable objects represented by a name preceded by a colon (:). They are often used as identifiers in the language. Here's an example:

```ruby
:name
```

## 10. Explain the concept of blocks in Ruby.

Answer:

Blocks in Ruby are chunks of code that can be passed to methods. They are often enclosed within {} or do..end and can be used to execute code in a controlled context. Blocks can take arguments and are commonly used for iteration and defining custom behavior.

## 11. How do you define a hash in Ruby? Provide an example.

Answer:

In Ruby, a hash is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can define a hash using curly braces ({}) and specify the keys and values. Here's an example:

```ruby
person = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" }
```

## 12. How do you handle file operations in Ruby? Provide an example of reading a file.

Answer:

In Ruby, you can handle file operations using the File class. Here's an example of reading a file:

```ruby
File.open("filename.txt", "r") do |file|
  puts file.read
end
```
